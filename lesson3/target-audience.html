            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p class="para-body"> The target audience is men and women in the age range of 18 to 65.  The audience will be those who have experience navigating the internet, and who use a variety of devices. In addition to the weather, the target audience will enjoy motivational and uplifting messages; many of these in this group will enjoy yoga, are spiritual, or are experiencing life difficulties. </p>
            <h2>Personas</h2>
            <p class="para-body"> <strong>Name:</strong> Ken Adams <br>
            <strong>About:</strong> Ken is 42, married, and has three teenage children. Ken works in retail management and coaches one of his children's volleyball teams.  He is on a mild anti-depressant and exercises every day to help with depression.  His days are long, and his nights are short.  Ken searches for motivational posters and sayings often. </p>
            <p class="para-body"><strong>Name:</strong> Ilene Raiffe <br>
            <strong>About:</strong> Ilene is 23, single, and an elementary school teacher.  She eats vegan, starts her day with yoga before going for a run, all before she goes to work.  She lives for social media and loves to share things that she does or what motivates her. </p>
            
            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <p class="para-body">Ken is going on a volleyball trip and needs to see what the weather will be like in the area that they are playing. He is checking to see if there will be traffic delays, as well as what clothes will be worn.</p>

            <p class="para-body">Ilene is planing her week and needs to know if there will be any dangerous weather that will prevent her from running in the early hours of the morning. </p>
                
            <p class="para-body">Ken is sick of the seemingly never-ending rainy days and is hoping to see some sun in the forecast.  When the forecast still says rain, he sees the motivational quote of the day and feels better. </P>
                
            <p class="para-body">Ilene's class has a field trip coming up, and she needs to let the parents know whether a light jacket will work, or if they should use a heavier coat. </p> 
                
            <p class="para-body">Ilene is surfing the internet during her downtime and checks the weather. When she sees a happy, sunshiny quote, she reposts it to her social media to share happiness with all of her followers. </p>
