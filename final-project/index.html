                        'MOM! That was so much fun!'  Is this what you heard from your kids last week?  We heard it lots. Our rafting rides are loved by the entire family and safe too.  Whether you are looking for a weekend away with the guys, a work outing, or some family togetherness time, our rafting trips are just right.    Our rafting guides have over 90 years of combined experience, and each one is an ACA Level 4 rafter.  And believe us, they have some great stories.  So whether this is your first ride or your fiftieth, let us take you down the river.  To get started, click on the button below, and we will help you pick the right adventure package.

                        Did you know that there are lots of different levels of rapids?  Here on the Salmon River, we have lots of smooth, easy rapids, and even some great challenging ones.  But, don't worry, our expert guides have conquered them all.  If you are feeling brave, we can tackle tough ones together. Feeling more timid, perhaps a leisurely kayaking trip is what you need.  Or do something in between.  Regardless, don't miss out on the nightly ice cream social (Monica makes some killer jam)! If the night is right, you might even get Phoebe to sing you a song (ask her about her smelly cat). Perhaps Joey will regale you with stories from his acting days (ask him about his Freud play...) Nights on the river are anything but dull.
